                <h1>Software I Use</h1>
                <img id="arch" alt="Arch Logo" src="p/arch.png">
                <h3>OS</h3>
                <p>For my operating system I use
                <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>.<br>
                When it comes
                to operating systems, you really can't go wrong with Linux.<br>
                I use Arch Linux because it is highly customizable and uses
                very little system resources.<br> For Linux beginners, I
                recommend Linux Mint since it is very user friendly.<br>
                I truly think that Unix based/like systems are superior to
                any other operating system.</p>
                <h3>Programs</h3>
                <h4>Web Browser</h4>
                <p>For my web browser I use <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a>ü¶Å. It's way better than Chrome, Opera, or Microsoft Edge for many reasons.
                First of all, Brave does not collect and sell your personal data. Second,
                Brave actually blocks unwanted ads, cookies, trackers, and etc.
                for better browsing. And Finally, you can make money
                (BAT tokens) from viewing ads, which no other web
                browser lets you do. Overall, I think that Brave is a very
                useful browser and you should definitely give it a try.</p>
                <h4>Desktop Environment/Window Manager</h4>
                <p>My window manager of choice is <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> (dynamic window manager).
                I was pretty hesitant when I first switched over to a window manager because it seemed pretty tough to use.
                However, I eventually got the hang of it and now I think that a window manager is way better for productivity.
                I use dwm in particular because it takes up very little system resources and it is very customizable.
                Although it takes some knowledge and skill to learn and customize dwm, it is well worth the trouble.</p>
                <h4>Terminal</h4>
                <p>I use <a href="https://st.suckless.org/">st</a> (suckless/simple terminal) for my terminal.
                st is very small and uses barely any system resources, it is also pretty customizable and extensible.
                I goes along pretty well with dwm.</p>
                <h4>Shell</h4>
                <p>For my shell, I use <a href="https://zsh.org">zsh</a>. It's compatible with bash and has a few features that I find very useful like syntax highlighting and auto completion.</p>
                <h4>Text/Code Editor</h4>
                <p>For text and code editing, I use both <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>.
                They are both very good editors, I mostly use Vim for quickly editing files and I use Emacs to work on larger files and projects.
                I have yet to decide which one I like more...</p>
                <h4>File Manager</h4>
                Normally for browsing files I just use the terminal.
                However, if I need to do something where a graphical file manager is very useful (like moving multiple files)
                then I use pcmanfm, which is very lightweight and has lots of useful features.</p>
                <h4>Documents, Spreadsheets, Etc.</h4>
                <p>I use <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">Libre Office</a>.
                Don't pay for Microsoft Office!!! Libre Office can do everything you need for FREE!
                Although I use Libre Office for most document-like needs, I am thinking about using other programs.
                <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/">groff</a> and <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> are both
                promising looking document compilers. <a href="https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im">sc-im</a> is also a very nice looking spreadsheet editor with various features.</p>
                <h4>Video and Audio</h4>
                <p>For video I use <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a>, almost everyone is using it nowadays and it's very versatile. For audio I use <a href="https://cmus.github.io">cmus</a>.
                Cmus works fine for me when it come to music.</p>
                <h4>Picture and Document Viewing</h4>
                <p>For image viewing I use <a href="https://github.com/muennich/sxiv">sxiv</a> because it's very simple. For document viewing I use <a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/">zathura</a>
                with different add-ons for PDF and document viewing. And finally, for presentations, I use <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/sent/">sent</a> for its simplicity.</p>
                <h4>Mail</h4>
                <p>I use <a href="https://neomutt.org/">neomutt</a>, which is a "better" version of mutt.
                I use a terminal based email client because when it comes to webmail, it can take forever to actually get to your email.
                First you have to open a browser, then go to your webmail site, then login. Neomutt does all of that for you.</p>
                <h3>Misc Software</h3>
                <p>This is misc. software I use that does not really fit into any category.</p>
