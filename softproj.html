                <p>I also have a sourcehut account that I use to upload all of the projects and repositories to
                due to GitHub being owned and operated by Microsoft. You can find my sourcehut here:</p>

                <h3>GitHub</h3>
                <p>I have stopped updating my projects to my GitHub account, consider it dead.
                The only reason I have it around is to contribute to other projects.
                If you want to visit me GitHub account you can find it <a href="https://github.com/ncvfg234560">here</a>.</p>
