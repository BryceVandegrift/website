                <p>I don't really have any big or meaningful pieces of software yet.
                However, I do have custom scripts and custom configurations of software on my
                GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ncvfg234560">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>SourceHut</h3>
                <p>I also have a sourcehut account that I plan to migrate all my software projects to in the future, I am also
                removing my GitHub in the future due to GitHub being owend and operated by Microsoft. You can find my sourcehut here:</p>
