                <h1>Why You Should Use Free Software ðŸ†“</h1>
		<p>Free software is the best type of software. Not free as in free beer, but free as in freedom.
		If you use free software, then you control your computer, but if you don't use free software then chances are that you don't control your computer.
		Richard Stallman, the founder of the GNU project (GNU is Not Unix) and the FSF (Free Software Foundation) makes plenty
		of excellent points in <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/20140407-geneva-tedx-talk-free-software-free-society">this</a> video.</p>
		<p>One of the greatest reasons to use free software over propritary software is the lack of malicous features.
		The majority of free software does not harmfull affect the user unlike propritary software which can spy on the user, slow the user's computer down, or deny the user access to thier own computer in some cases!
		In fact, the GNU project has an entire section of thier website dedicated to the malicous features of propritary software <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html">here</a>.</p>
		<p>You can find a countless amount of free programs in the FSF's free software directory <a href="https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Main_Page">here</a>.
		There you can find a free program for any use. Need a free replacement for Microsoft Office? Use <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>. Need a free web browser?
		Use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>. Need a free media player? Use <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>. There is a free program for every use and problem.
		If you need software for a very specific task, there's probably a free software solution.</p>
