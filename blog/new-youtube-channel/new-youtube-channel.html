<h1 id="new-youtube-channel">New YouTube Channel</h1>
<p>Recently, I have decided to start up a YouTube channel. I mostly plan to upload informative videos, but things could always change. Right now, I am uploading videos about GNU/Linux and other technical topics related to technology, however I believe that I will expand in the future.</p>
<p>In the future, I plan to upload all of my past and future videos onto Odysee/LBRY as I think itâ€™s a superior platform compared to YouTube. I might even consider uploading to other niche video sites eventually.</p>
<p>You can view my first video about GnuPG (GPG) <a href="https://youtu.be/GhiLR4zRqMI">here</a>.</p>
