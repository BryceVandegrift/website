<h1 id="changing-my-website-host">Changing My Website Host</h1>
<p>For the longest time I have used <a
href="https://www.infinityfree.net/">Infinity Free</a> as the host for
my website since it has free website hosting. However, I haven’t been
able to successfully set up a SSL certificate without using Cloudflare.
Cloudflare has not had a good reputation and, in my opinion, <a
href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/stay-away-from-cloudflare.html">cannot
be trusted</a> <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/cloudflare">at
all</a>.</p>
<p>My final solution in the long run is to self host my website and
everything that I need on a home computer. But for now, I have a few
decent choices for hosting my website:</p>
<h2 id="sourcehut">1. <a href="https://sourcehut.org">Sourcehut</a></h2>
<p>Sourcehut provides static website hosting, git repository hosting,
gemini hosting (sadly no gopher hosting) and many other things. The
upside of using Sourcehut versus a lot of other platforms for hosting my
website is that they use only free and open source software for
hosting.</p>
<p>Hosted websites are automatically outfitted with SSL certificates
which reduces the hassle (and they don’t use Cloudflare). My git
repositories are also hosted at Sourcehut so it would make sense to move
my website there. Sourcehut also provides paste bins, mailing lists,
wikis, and more useful tools.</p>
<p>One caveat is that, even though service is currently 100% free (as in
free beer), once Sourcehut is out of alpha, there will probably be a
price tag associated with all the services (although, right now the
price doesn’t look that bad.)</p>
<h2 id="get-a-vps">2. Get a VPS</h2>
<p>This may be my best option in the long run as it’s the closest thing
to self hosting that I can get. I can host my website, git repositories,
as well as almost anything else that I like including chat servers,
forums, email, and etc.</p>
<p>The biggest downside of this is the price, which can vary from a
couple dozen dollars a year to a few <strong>hundred</strong> dollars a
year.</p>
<h2 id="move-to-some-other-3rd-party-static-site-host">3. Move to some
other 3rd party static site host</h2>
<p>I’m probably more likely to self host my website before I resort to
hosting it using <em>another</em> not well known 3rd party service. My
trust in most 3rd party hosts is slowly dwindling as the years go
by.</p>
<h2 id="the-verdict">The verdict</h2>
<p>I currently plan to move my website to Sourcehut hosting for the time
being, however I plan to eventually self host everything I need and
become self reliant. I also might move my website to a more elegant
static site generator as writing and managing everything from scratch is
starting to make everything a bit more cumbersome.</p>
