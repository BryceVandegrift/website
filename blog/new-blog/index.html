<h1 id="new-blog">New Blog</h1>
<p>Recently, I have been working on a new blog system that takes Markdown and converts it into a very simple HTML page as well as an RSS feed. The blog system is written entirely in POSIX shell and is around 100 lines of code.</p>
<p>If succesful, it should generate a blog page, an RSS feed, as well as a rolling blog index page. The only downside is that it requires Pandoc which isn’t that small of a package, but it makes making blog posts a lot easier to write as I can write in Markdown instead of HTML.</p>
<p>I based some of it from Luke Smith’s blog script <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">here</a>. I have added a few querks of my own and I also plan to greatly expand on it in the future.</p>
