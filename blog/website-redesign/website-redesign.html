<h1 id="website-redesign">Website Redesign</h1>
<p>I have decided to redesign most of my website. It’s mostly a facelift, but there are a couple under-the-hood changes done.</p>
<p>I have also decided to officially add a link to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSqzSTg4QZXdi7jvV-9rUg">YouTube channel</a> on my homepage, as well as add a link to my <a href="https://sr.ht/~bpv/">Sourcehut page</a> and my <a href="https://brycevandegrift.xyz/rss.xml">rss feed</a>.</p>
<p>I plan to reorganize my website as time goes on, but for now a simple redesign will do. I also plan to at least convert my homepage to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Html/html_xhtml.asp">xhtml</a> in the future, as I think that I would provide a bit more compatibility with web browsers.</p>
<p>As time goes on I will make changes to my website as needed.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-about-github-and-gitlab">A note about GitHub and GitLab</h2>
<p>If you don’t know already, I am not a big fan of GitHub. I don’t like having a GitHub account, but it’s almost necessary for collaborating on projects. I have updated my <a href="https://github.com/BryceVandegrift">GitHub account</a> and created a <a href="https://gitlab.com/BryceVandegrift">GitLab account</a> for hosting my git repos. Don’t expect me to answer issues or accept code from these platforms (for now (although that might change)), for that please visit my Sourcehut page.</p>
