<h1 id="gone-for-two-weeks">Gone for Two Weeks</h1>
<p>For the past two weeks I have been working/volunteering for <a
href="https://www.roboticseducation.org/vex-robotics-world-championship/">VEX
Worlds</a> 2022 in Dallas, Texas. So if you have been expecting a video
recently, then sorry about that. But, if any of you reading this are in
middle school/high school then this event might be interesting to you if
you like robotics (or just VEX robotics in general).</p>
<p>If requested, I could make a video on the whole event, but I don’t
think that it would be of much interest to any of you (especially since
it didn’t even interest me that much).</p>
