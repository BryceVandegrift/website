<h1 id="personal-update">Personal Update</h1>
<p>Recently, I have been pretty busy with college classes and havenâ€™t had much time to work on personal projects. In addition to classes I have also been busy with other personal aspects of life which I would not like to disclose currently. I will be active again once I finish the semester (hopefully).</p>
<p>If anything comes up feel free to email me at: <a href="mailto://bryce@brycevandegrift.xyz">bryce@brycevandegrift.xyz</a>.</p>
