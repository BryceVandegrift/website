## Power Supply

The power supply I use is the [CSI3010SW](https://www.circuitspecialists.com/csi3010sw.html).
This power supply is like any other except it can go up to 10 amps.
This power supply is also a switching power supply, which means it a produce a fair bit of electrical noise.
It was around $60-70 when I bought it, but it has gone up in price,
I would recommend a cheaper power supply.

## Multimeter

I use the [CSI2010](https://www.circuitspecialists.com/digital-multimeter-csi2010.html) for my multimeter.
This is a fairly cheap and accurate multimeter for the price.
It does not have that many fancy features but gets the job done.

## Soldering Station

For soldering I use the 862D+.
This is a soldering/hot air station.
For me, it has been pretty reliable and works well.
The soldering station uses an internal transformer, which means you might hear a slight humming,
otherwise it's pretty solid.
I am considering getting a cheaper and smaller portable soldering iron in the
future, but for now, I am stuck with this.

## Oscilloscope

The oscilloscope I use is the [Rigol DS1054Z](https://www.rigolna.com/products/digital-oscilloscopes/1000z/).
A very good price for a very good oscilloscope.
The Rigol DS1054Z has lots of features for its price.
It's the only 4 channel scope I know that's below $500.
It also has a 100MHz frequency range, a insanely good memory depth, and a great sample rate.
If you want a starter oscilloscope, this is perhaps the best deal on the market.
There are some features that are locked behind a payment system for this
oscilloscope, but you can bypass them using [this](https://gotroot.ca/rigol/riglol/) website.

## Programmer

For programming EEPROMS, PROMS, and etc. I use the TL866II Plus.
It can program almost any IC that you can think of.
For what I do (microcontroller programming), it gets the job done well.
If you want to use this with Linux you can use [minipro](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro/), it lets you program ICs using Linux, BSD, or most Unix based systems.
