## SourceHut

I have a sourcehut account that I use to upload all of the projects and repositories to due to GitHub being owned and operated by Microsoft.
You can find my sourcehut here:

[My sourcehut page](https://sr.ht/~bpv/)

## GitHub

I mirror my projects to my GitHub account, but it don't regularly check it.
The only reason I have it around is to contribute to other projects.
If you want to visit me GitHub account you can find it here:

### My Dotfiles

I have all my personal configurations, scripts, and more in my dotfile
repository. Feel free to use them however you want, you can find them

### pm

After seeing a lot of plugin managers for Vim and NeoVim that are unnecessary
complicated and bloated I decided to create `pm`. `pm` (short for plugin
manager) is just a simple (or stupidly simple) plugin manager that is written
in less that **100 lines of code** that relies on the new automatic plugin
loading system for Vim and NeoVim to make the process of adding, updating, and
removing plugins extremely simple. If you would like to use it you can
download it [here](https://sr.ht/~bpv/pm/).
