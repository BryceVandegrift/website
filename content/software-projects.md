### sbs

sbs is my static blogging system created for my website's [blog](https://brycevandegrift.xyz/blog) here.
It is written entirely in POSIX shell script and uses Pandoc to convert Markdown into a readable webpage.

### SourceHut

I have a sourcehut account that I use to upload all of the projects and repositories to due to GitHub being owned and operated by Microsoft.
You can find my sourcehut here:

### GitHub

I have stopped updating my projects to my GitHub account, consider it dead.
The only reason I have it around is to contribute to other projects.
If you want to visit me GitHub account you can find it here:
