### OS

{{< img src="/p/void.png" link="https://voidlinux.org" >}}

For my operating system I use [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/).
When it comes to operating systems, you really can't go wrong with Linux.
I use Void Linux because it is highly customizable and uses very little system resources.
For Linux beginners, I recommend Linux Mint since it is very user friendly.
I truly think that Unix based/like systems are superior to any other operating system.

### Programs

#### Web Browser

My web browser of choice is [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/).
Qutebrowser is a keyboard driven web browser that uses Vim key bindings by default.
It's very lightweight compared to almost every other major web browser out there like Chrome, Edge, and even Firefox.
Qutebrowser can be configured in Python making it easy to program in extra features without any hassle.
My only gripe with Qutebrowser is that it is written in Python rather than a compiled language, but that can be easily forgiven.
It is by far the best web browser I have used so far.

#### Desktop Environment/Window Manager

My window manager of choice is [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) (dynamic window manager).
I was pretty hesitant when I first switched over to a window manager because it seemed pretty tough to use.
However, I eventually got the hang of it and now I think that a window manager is way better for productivity.
I use dwm in particular because it takes up very little system resources and it is very customizable.
Although it takes some knowledge and skill to learn and customize dwm, it is well worth the trouble.

#### Terminal

I use [st](https://st.suckless.org/) (suckless/simple terminal) for my terminal.
st is very small and uses barely any system resources, it is also pretty customizable and extensible.
I goes along pretty well with dwm.

#### Shell

For my shell, I use [zsh](https://zsh.org/).
It's compatible with bash and has a few features that I find very useful like syntax highlighting and auto completion.

#### Text/Code Editor

For text and code editing I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).
Neovim is a community driven fork of the popular Vim editor with a cleaner code base and other features like first class Lua support, sensible defaults, and is fully compatible with Vim.
I really like being able to use Lua to write scripts for Neovim rather than Vimscript, as I think that programming in Vimscript can be a pain sometimes.
I think that Neovim is the superior editor to Vim.

#### File Manager

Normally for browsing files I just use the terminal.
However, if I need to do something where a graphical file manager is very useful (like moving multiple files) then I use pcmanfm, which is very lightweight and has lots of useful features.

#### Documents, Spreadsheets, Etc.

I use [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/).
Don't pay for Microsoft Office!!!
Libre Office can do everything you need for FREE!
Although I use Libre Office for most document-like needs, I am thinking about using other programs.
[groff](https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) are both promising looking document compilers.
[sc-im](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im) is also a very nice looking spreadsheet editor with various features.

#### Video and Audio

For video I use [mpv](https://mpv.io/), almost everyone is using it nowadays and it's very versatile.
For audio I use [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org/) and [ncmpcpp](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp).
mpd is the daemon that runs underneith ncmpcpp that sorts the music, plays the music, and etc.
ncmpcpp is a very feature rich client for mpd that works very well.

#### Picture and Document Viewing

For image viewing I use [sxiv](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv) because it's very simple.
For document viewing I use [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) with different add-ons for PDF and document viewing.
And finally, for presentations, I use [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/) for its simplicity.

#### Mail

I use [neomutt](https://neomutt.org/), which is a "better" version of mutt.
I use a terminal based email client because when it comes to webmail, it can take forever to actually get to your email.
First you have to open a browser, then go to your webmail site, then login.
Neomutt does all of that for you.

### Misc Software

This is misc. software I use that does not really fit into any category.

- Torrents: [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)
- Image Editors: [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for vector graphics, and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) for everything else.
- Audio/Video Editing: [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
