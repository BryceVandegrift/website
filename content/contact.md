I have various ways that you can contact me if desired. I prefer being
contacted by email or XMPP, but you can contact me by any means necessary.
Please note that I may not respond immediately.

## ðŸ“§ Email

My main email address is: `bryce at brycevandegrift.xyz`

- All valid emails from me will be signed with my fingerprint:
  `FCE5 8027 5F59 3358 228D 3840 EB4C 94BC D257 DBA9`
- You can grab my public GPG/PGP key for encryption [here](/bpv.gpg) or you
  can run this command to import my key:

  `curl -fsL "https://brycevandegrift.xyz/bpv.gpg" | gpg --import`

## ðŸ’¬ XMPP

My main XMPP address is the same as my email
address: `bryce at brycevandegrift.xyz`

- My OMEMO fingerprint for encryption: `543A0F46 033EDB87 2FB96CBA 0D20E8E1
D0BA5AB4 95EDF7E5 EB823DC8 FDD31078`

## Other

- You can sometimes find me on `irc.libera.chat` as `bpv`
- If you want to send me a letter or mail please email me first.
