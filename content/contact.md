I have various ways that you can contact me if desired. I prefer being
contacted via email or XMPP, but you can contact me by any means necessary.
Please note that I may not respond immediately.

## 📧 Email

My main email address is: {{< rawhtml >}}<code>bry<!-- Nice try bots -->ce@b<!-- Quit grabbing my email -->rycev.com</code>{{</ rawhtml >}}

> - All valid emails from me will be signed with my fingerprint:
> 
>   `FCE5 8027 5F59 3358 228D 3840 EB4C 94BC D257 DBA9`
> 
> - You can grab my public GPG/PGP key for encryption [here](/bpv.gpg) or you
>   can run this command to import my key:
> 
>   `curl -fsL "https://brycev.com/bpv.gpg" | gpg --import`

## 💬 XMPP

**NOTE: I am currently migrating my XMPP address.**
My main XMPP address is the same as my email
address: {{< rawhtml >}}<code>bryce@bry<!-- Nice try bots -->cevandegrift.x<!-- No email for you -->yz</code>{{</ rawhtml>}}

> - My OMEMO fingerprint for encryption:
> 
>   `543A0F46 033EDB87 2FB96CBA 0D20E8E1 D0BA5AB4 95EDF7E5 EB823DC8 FDD31078`

## Other

- You can sometimes find me on `irc.libera.chat` as `bpv`
- If you want to send me a letter or mail please email me or send me an XMPP
message first.
