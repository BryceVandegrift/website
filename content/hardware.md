## Desktop

### CPU

My CPU is an AMD Ryzen 4600g.
When it comes to CPU and GPU power, I really don't need much, so a 6 core
12 thread CPU is definitely enough for me. The most I do with it is compiling
large programs and video editing.
You can even overclock the CPU if you want a little extra performance.

### GPU

I don't use a discrete GPU, I just use the built in graphics that come with my AMD 4600g.
This GPU/APU uses Radeon at 1.9 GHz which is pretty OK, but you can always overclock it if you want extra graphical performance.
I don't overclock my graphics because I don't really play any video games, especially on my computer.

### Motherboard

My motherboard is an ASRock B450M Steel Legend.
I bought this motherboard because it was on sale and it had some pretty useful features.
Although I'm not a big fan of RGB lights in general, I really don't mind the lights on the motherboard.
It also has useful ports like USB-C, optical audio, and even Display Port for those who need it.

### RAM

I use OLOy DDR4 2x8GB RAM sticks.
I clock my ram at around 2.933 GHz because it's the fastest supported speed for my CPU/APU.
For me personally, any amount of RAM over 16GB is overkill, at least for what
I normally do day to day.

### PSU

My PSU is EVGA 600W Bronze power supply, which is somewhat overkill
considering that my CPU and GPU combined only draw around 65 watts max.
I really don't care what PSU I use as long as it's safe (doesn't catch on
fire) and delivers the right amount of power.

### Drives

I have 2 drives in my desktop, one HDD and one SSD.
The SSD I use is a Western Digital Black 256GB SN730.
It is an NVMe drive so it's pretty dang fast, I don't think I have ever had to physically wait when it came to moving files on this drive.
I use this drive to store my bootloader/OS as well as small a frequently used files like documents, programs, and etc.
My HDD is Seagate BarraCuda 2TB 7200 RPM.
I mostly use this drive to store large files like movies, games, pictures, and etc.
It's a little slow, but I'm very patient.

### Case

My case is a "be quiet!" ATX case. I got it because it was on a very nice sale.
I am unsure what model my case is, but the title *is* true, it's very quiet.

## Laptops

### Lenovo Thinkpad
My main laptop is a Lenovo Thinkpad X220.
First things first, Thinkpads are built like tanks.
I could drop this laptop from a rooftop and it will probably still work afterwords.
Although this laptop isn't that fast, since it's almost 10 years old, I don't really need a fast computer for my work.
All of my computing can easily be done on a 10 year old computer.
I also replaced the stock BIOS on this laptop with [Coreboot](https://coreboot.org/).

### Other Laptops

I have various other junk laptops laying around that family or friends have
given me. I use these every once in a while for various small tasks, but I
don't take them with me if I go anywhere.

## Keyboards, Mice, Etc.

### Keyboard

I use a [Unicomp](https://www.pckeyboard.com/) Classic.
When it comes to keyboards, you can't beat the IBM Model M, and the Unicomp Classic is as close to a Model M as you can get.
This keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever used, period.
Although this keyboard isn't a Model M it is as close as you can get to an IBM Model M.
Believe it or not, Unicomp actually bought the tooling and molds that were used
to make the Model M directly from IBM.
Pretty rad.

### Mouse

My mouse is Logitech three button mouse. Why?
Because it's the best mouse that I currently have and I barely use my mouse as
it is, so I don't really mind.
I don't prefer wireless mice because I think that replacing the batteries on them is annoying.

### Monitor

My main monitor is an HP 24mh.
When it comes to desktop monitors, all I really need is something that can do 1080p.
Although color accuracy is somewhat important to me, I really don't care if a monitor's color accuracy is good or not.

## Other Things

### Phone

I've never been a big fan of cell phones.
Despite that, I still use a cell phone because in this day and age people
just *require* you to have a cell phone.
I *do not* and *will not* download random apps on my phone.
I only have a handful of stock applications on my phone, and that is
all I will *ever* need.
I personally have a Google Pixel 3a that I flashed [Graphene OS](https://grapheneos.org/) onto.
