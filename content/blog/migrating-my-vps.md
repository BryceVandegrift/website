Please note that on February 11, 2025 I will be migrating my VPS to a
different operating system. This means that my website, email, and XMPP server
will be down for most of the day. If you need to contact me please wait until
Feburary 12, 2025.

I've been using Debian stable on my VPS ever since I
wrote my [original post](/blog/i-finally-have-a-vps) about getting a VPS,
however I have decided that I would like to use
[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) on my VPS instead. OpenBSD offers more
security while still being very simple which fits my needs a lot more for a
server operating system when compared to Debian stable.

After migrating my system, I'll most likely create a guide on how to setup an
OpenBSD system as it's pretty easy, but not a well documented process.
