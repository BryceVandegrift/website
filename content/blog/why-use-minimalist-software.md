> "OK"

In this day and age barely anybody cares about software size or speed.
Most people just want one giant and bloated software suite that does almost
100 different things. You can see this in things like Google's software suite
that includes email, document processing, presentations, a search engine, maps,
and almost everything else. Google isn't the only perpetrator when it comes
to giant software suites, Microsoft is also very guilty of this. Software
suites like these are basically just entire **operating systems** that you
can access from your browser.

Desktop programs and applications aren't that much better. Programs like
Microsoft Word and other Microsoft programs take up an abhorrent amount of
space on your hard drive (or SSD) and use way too many system resources.
A computer from 20 years ago probably couldn't run a modern version of
Microsoft Word.

These homogeneous software suites and other pieces of bloated software don't
seem that bad at first, but appearances aren't always as they seem. Google's,
Microsoft's, and other company's online suites can't even be accessed if you
aren't connected to the internet. Programs like Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat,
and others even have **security issues**.

Let me repeat that...
