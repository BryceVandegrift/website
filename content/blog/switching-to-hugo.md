Over the last couple of days I have been migrating my blog from using a
markdown/Pandoc blog system to using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for my entire website.

For those of you who don't know what Hugo is, Hugo is a static site generator
that is written in [Go](https://go.dev/). It takes plain markdown and converts
it to plain HTML and CSS just like Pandoc. The biggest difference it has from
Pandoc is that Hugo is written specifically for creating static sites. To put
it bluntly, Hugo does one thing, and it does it well.

I might make a video on Hugo on some point as there's actually a lot of depth
to it and it's very customizable and extensible. But despite having a lot of
depth to it, Hugo generates relatively small and fast static webpages.
It's honestly a very good static site generator and I will be using it over my
markdown/Pandoc blog system from now on.
