I've been wanting to post more articles on my blog, however I often
find myself away from my computer or I often have more important
tasks to take care of on my computer. Either way, I can't write
as many articles for my blog as I would like to on my computer.

It wasn't until I read a blog post by Ray Patrick (who
has sadly taken down his blog) titled
["In Praise of the Manual Typewriter"](https://web.archive.org/web/20240229190333if_/https://raypatrick.xyz/blog/2024/01/24/in-praise-of-the-manual-typewriter/)
that I formed an idea. I could type out the articles
that I want to compose on a typewriter. This would allow me to
formulate any articles that I would like to later post to my blog.
I could also handwrite any articles if needed.

I've been in possession of a Royal Mercury typewriter
for quite some time now and I have been looking to get some use
out of it. It's a somewhat small, portable typewriter that is easy
to carry around. This means that I can take it with me almost anywhere
that I go. And guess what? I don't have to constantly keep it charged
like a laptop...although it does need paper and ink which could be
a slight disadvantage.

I also realized that I could use OCR (Optical Character
Recognition) programs like [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/)
in order to easily convert
anything that I type or write while I'm away from my computer into
text to put on my blog. I might have to do some manual editing and
correcting once it's converted into plaintext, but I think that
the extra effort would be well worth it.

This method of writing articles might very much help me
to write more in general, not just for my blog. Keep an eye out
though, you might see me putting more on my blog/website within the
upcoming months.
