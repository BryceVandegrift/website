For those of you who don't already know, I recently synced my entire YouTube
channel to [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@bryce:c). So for those of you who want to avoid YouTube and Google
entirely that is now an option. I will continue to upload videos to YouTube
but they will be automaticly synced to Odysee shortly after I upload them
(usually takes about an hour). I don't plan on uploading exclusively onto
Odysee, but I might post some videos that I normally wouldn't post onto
YouTube for one reason or another, so keep an eye out. üßë‚ÄçüöÄ
