After a little less than a year of waiting, I finally obtained a VPS
from [Frantech/BuyVM](https://my.frantech.ca/). I was told that they are an
exceptional VPS provider, and it turns out to be **true**. Their pricing is
extremely fair as I can get *double* what [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/)
offers for the same exact price (plus unlimited bandwidth). Their support
was also pretty fast so I was able to setup everything relatively quickly.
My only complaint is that the number of servers is limited so it might take
a while to actually get one. Despite Frantech *obviously* being better, Vultr
is still a solid choice for a VPS and they make it very easy to setup one.

I am now hosting my web page from my VPS instead of [Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/)
and I am hosting my email instead of using [Disroot](https://disroot.org).
Keep in mind that these services (Sourcehut and Disroot[^1]) are great services
and I would 100% recommend them, however I believe that hosting everything
yourself is better.

That being said, I do have unlimited bandwidth and about 19GB of storage space
that I still have yet to use. If any of you guys have ideas for what I should
do (hosting internet radio, SearX instance, Mastodon instance, forum, etc.) you
can let me know by email.

If you would like a VPS for yourself, you can use the links above to get one
from Frantech, if they're available. If not, Vultr is always a solid option
for a VPS (although you do get less). **Or** you can use my referral links
to get a VPS below. It's a nice and indirect way to support me.

### Referral Links

- [Frantech/BuyVM](https://my.frantech.ca/aff.php?aff=6418)
- [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9386356) (Normal affiliate link)
- [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9386357-8H) (**Get $100** to use for a VPS)

[^1]: Disroot provides services like cloud storage, XMPP chat, paste bin, Git,
and more. They're an amazing replacement for the Google suite.
