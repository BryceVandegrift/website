It's about time that I got a new domain name for my website. My current/old
domain name, [brycevandegrift.xyz](https://brycevandegrift.xyz), is quite a
cumbersome and unorthodox domain name. It's not easy to remember and the
`.xyz` domain name can also be somewhat confusing. Not only that, but I've had
less tech literate people tell me that they thought my domain wasn't actually
a real domain name. Add to the fact that many email services automatically
mark `.xyz` domain names as spam, and you can see why I want to change my
domain name.

I originally got a `.xyz` domain name because it was fairly cheap (only
**99Â¢**!), however using my *full* name was probably not the right way to go.
My emails also got marked as spam or just filtered by some email servers.

## New domain name

I've been eyeballing **[brycev.com](https://brycev.com)** for quite some time and
I finally pulled the trigger and bought it. `.com` domains are usually the
most memorable and trusted domain names out there so I decided to go with
that. Right now `brycev.com` just redirects to `brycevandegrift.xyz`, but over
the next few weeks I will be slowly replacing instances of my old domain name
with my new domain name. I will probably also keep `brycevandegrift.xyz`
indefinitely and have it redirect to `brycev.com`.

I'll slowly migrate my website, email, and XMPP server over to using my new
domain name. I'll also need to issue a new GPG/PGP key for my new email
address. So keep an eye out and I'll post any necessary updates.
