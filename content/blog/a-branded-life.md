Modern "brands" are a weird thing when you really think about them.
Disney, Hewlett Packard, and Nike. What do all 3 of these have in common?
They're all considered brands. But what exactly is a brand? Before the
industrial age, a brand was just a way to differentiate a product from a
competitor's product. In order to differentiate it one would often *brand*
their name or alias in the product itself.[^1] However, the concept of a
brand has evolved over the last 100-200 years. Instead of being just a
name or logo, a brand is often associated with what people hear
(jingles/slogans), taste, see, and more. How many times have you heard
someone say, "Hey, this **X** is just like **Y** brand?" As a result of this
recognition, modern branding strategies have exploded in popularity. For the
companies that brand their products like this, it creates more customer
loyalty and therefore more money.

But is branding (in the modern sense) a good thing?

## Everything is a Brand

One thing that I tend to find very annoying is the modern obsession of brands
to the point where **everything** has to be a brand. From homemade crafts to
personal websites, it seems like there are so many attempts at creating a
modern brand that are just not necessary.

Let me share an experience that I had somewhat recently. I had a friend
buy me a book from a local book shop as a gift. When I received it I thanked
them for the gift and I read it later. I noticed something rather odd
about this book...there was **no** branding. **No** *brand name*, **no** name, and
not even a **copyright notice**. Needless to say I was taken back by this
as it seemed abnormal. But why did I think it was abnormal? If I had to guess,
it was probably because seeing someone not milking their work and
committing a sort of selfless act seemed out of place, especially in this
day and age.

When was the last time you saw a book without a logo or brand name?
I only have two books in my *entire* collection that fit that criteria.
Actually, when is the last time you saw **anything** without a logo
or brand name? Go through the room you're in right now and count how many
items you have that don't have a brand name and or logo. No, seriously, do it.
You will be genuinely surprised.[^2]

## The Safe Zone

One very important downside of modern brands that impact customers is
what I like to call the "*safe zone*". The "safe zone" is a situation in which a
customer buys products of specific brands either due to trust, loyalty,
familiarity, or a mix of all three. This results in the customer not buying
anything else unless it's from one of their chosen brands.

This usually results in dependence on a specific brand. This is, of course,
intended. And while it is **very** beneficial to the brand itself, it can
be detrimental to the customer. On one hand, the customer is provided safety
and security knowing that what they get from a specific brand will be
(mostly) consistent. On the other hand, this can trap the customer into
dependence on a brand since not buying from a trusted brand would
be too "risky" or "unsafe" (hence the name "safe zone").

This effect can happen on such a large scale that many brand names are
immediately associated with a non-branded objects. For example, do you hear
people say cola or Coca-Cola more? Do you hear people say tissue or
Kleenex more? Do you hear people say slow cooker or Crock-Pot more? The
list goes on and on. Not only does this result in other products being
noticed less, but it also draws a negative light on other products and make
them seem inferior compared to larger brands.

## DRM

[Digital Restrictions Management](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm),
more commonly referred to as Digital Rights Management, is one way that a
brand keeps customers. DRM essentially restricts what the customer/user
can do with a product. This is usually very prevalent among popular
companies/brands especially in the technology sector.

The best example I can probably think of is ink cartridges for inkjet printers.
Most major brands of inkjet printers use proprietary ink cartridges with DRM
built into the cartridges themselves. If you try to use a different type of ink
cartridge on your printer, **it won't work**. If you try to refill the ink in
your cartridge, **it won't work**. If you buy third party ink cartridges,
**they won't work**.[^3] It's not because it is "incompatible", it's ink,
it's because the manufacturer wants to force you into brand loyalty and to
buy their products.

Now it doesn't take a genius to understand that DRM is bad, but for the
handful of people who don't understand why DRM is *objectively* awful,
here are a few [links to](https://creativecommons.org/2017/07/09/terrible-horrible-no-good-bad-drm/)

Although the modern conception of branding is very beneficial from an economic
and financial standpoint, it can have many negative side effects outside the
economic and financial realm. It can result in enforcing restrictions on the
customer, physiologically locking them into dependence, and creates obsession
with branding. Although this is great for the brand owners, it sucks for the
everyday customer. Granted, there are many more factors that go into branding
but I think these points really highlight the nature of the current situation.

[^1]: This, of course, is a centuries old tradition and goes all the way back
to branding livestock to prove ownership.

[^2]: Unless you make it a habit to tear off labels and branding of products
that you buy. In which case, I wouldn't blame you for doing that.

[^3]: And this isn't made any better by the fact that inkjet printer ink
is extremely expensive, especially if it is purchased from the manufacturers
themselves.
