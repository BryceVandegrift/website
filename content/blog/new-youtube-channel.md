Recently, I have decided to start up a YouTube channel.
I mostly plan to upload informative videos, but things could always change.
Right now, I am uploading videos about GNU/Linux and other technical topics related to technology, however I believe that I will expand in the future.

In the future, I plan to upload all of my past and future videos onto Odysee/LBRY as I think itâ€™s a superior platform compared to YouTube.
I might even consider uploading to other niche video sites eventually.

You can view my first video about GnuPG (GPG) [here](https://youtu.be/GhiLR4zRqMI).
