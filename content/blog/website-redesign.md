I have decided to redesign most of my website.
It’s mostly a facelift, but there are a couple under-the-hood changes done.

I have also decided to officially add a link to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSqzSTg4QZXdi7jvV-9rUg) on my homepage, as well as add a link to my [Sourcehut page](https://sr.ht/~bpv/) and my [rss feed](https://brycevandegrift.xyz/rss.xml).

I plan to reorganize my website as time goes on, but for now a simple redesign will do.
I also plan to at least convert my homepage to [xhtml](https://www.w3schools.com/Html/html_xhtml.asp) in the future, as I think that I would provide a bit more compatibility with web browsers.

As time goes on I will make changes to my website as needed.

## A note about GitHub and GitLab

If you don’t know already, I am not a big fan of GitHub.
I don’t like having a GitHub account, but it’s almost necessary for collaborating on projects.
I have updated my [GitHub account](https://github.com/BryceVandegrift) for hosting my git repos.
Don’t expect me to answer issues or accept code from these platforms (for now (although that might change)), for that please visit my Sourcehut page.
