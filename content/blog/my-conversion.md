I've been putting off writing this blog post for 2 (almost 3) years now.
There **is** a good reason for why I did that. Part of it was that I didn't
know how to put my experience into words until now, and the other part
was just procrastination. So now I feel like I finally have the experience
and knowledge to write about something that is very important to me.

## A Bit of Background

In the past I have never really been a religious person, nor have I really
ever liked religion. I always either found it silly, meaningless, or something
between those two. In high school I was something akin to Agnostic, I didn't
fully believe in God, but I wasn't really sure.
In middle school I was a proud Atheist who had a smug
satisfaction "knowing" that God did not exist. So take my word when I say the
events within the past few years of my life completely took me by surprise.

## I Am Now A Roman Catholic

Ok, *technically* I've been a Catholic for the last 2-3 years and I got
confirmed last year, but I've been
putting off "officially" saying anything until now. I was actually considering
Catholicism when I originally started this blog all the way back in November of
2021 (my [first blog post](https://brycevandegrift.xyz/blog/new-blog/)), but I
didn't start taking it seriously until sometime in 2022.
For me, it seemed like it all happened very quickly.

I actually did consider quite a few. I considered different forms of
Christianity like Anglicanism, Orthodoxy, and even Baptist[^1]. I even
considered things like Islam, Buddhism, and even Hinduism briefly. However, I
never found a intellectual tradition that truly rivaled Catholic tradition[^2].
I also personally looked for the religion that I thought was 100% **true** and
Catholicism seemed to fit that bill.
It should go without saying, but
basing your religious decisions on anything else besides truth (like personal
preference) is a very small brained move.

I didn't really have a bias either. I used to **hate** the Catholic Church, but
I soon grew to find out that my hatred was *very* much misplaced. As Venerable
Archbishop Fulton Sheen put it:

> "Not 100 people in the United States hate the Roman Catholic Church, but
> millions hate what they think the Roman Catholic Church is." --Archbishop
> Fulton J. Sheen

This very much encapsulates the essence of what stopped me from converting to
Catholicism in the past. I hated what I *thought* Catholicism was, but I soon
came to love what it *actually* is.

## Joining a Webring

After being invited to the [Heaven Tree](https://heaventree.xyz) webring almost
a year ago, I decided to accept the invitation last month. Now I didn't wait a
year to accept the invitation just to be rude. I waited quite a while because I
was not sure if I really wanted to identify as a Catholic or even as a Christian
for that matter. It really took me the last year to solidify my identity as a
Catholic and to accept it. So I sort of think that joining this webring is
me cementing myself as a Catholic.

## What Now?

Not much about my blog or YouTube channel will change...at least in the short
term. I might post more stuff about theology or other topics related to it, but
as always I don't really have a specific direction for my blog or channel. I
just post about whatever I feel like saying and that's the way it will probably
always be. So don't be surprised if things change over time.

I am very grateful for my conversion and all that it has brought me. DEO GRATIAS.

[^1]: The only reason I even **remotely** considered Baptist was due to their
incredible zeal. Baptist theology is extremely deficient and almost
non-sensical.

[^2]: I mean, have you even looked at the Summa Theologica?
